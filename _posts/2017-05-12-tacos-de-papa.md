### Ingredients
- ½ head cauliflower
- ¼ tsp ground cumin
- ¼ tsp ground coriander
- ¼ tsp mexican oregano, ground
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tbsp oil

#### Optionals
- salsa
- green leafies
- avocado

### Process
heat up a skillet or similar to medium high heat. chop or separate your cauliflower into equal bite-sized pieces or florets. in a bowl, mix the cauliflower with the oil.


when the skillet is hot, add your cauliflower and let roast on one side. lower the heat a bit so you don't burn your cauliflower. after about 3 minutes, shake the skillet or toss the cauliflower with a utensil. let roast another 3 to 4 minutes. put cauliflower back into bowl where you mixed it with oil and add your spices. toss the cauliflower to coat all of it with the spices. i use my hand for this step. much easier.


pour the cauliflower back into the skillet and roast, tossing every minute or so until they're done to your liking. pour back in bowl, sprinkle with salt and toss again.


to make the tacos, heat your tortilla, add some cauliflower, a green leafy (i used spinach), some avocado and salsa. serve with some simple black beans and boom... powerhouse meal. whole grain, beans, green leafies, cruciferous veg and lots of flavor.
