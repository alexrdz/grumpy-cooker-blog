### INGREDIENTS

2 tsp coriander

2 tsp ground cumin

2 tsp mexican oregano

1 tsp paprika

1 chile pasilla , seeded and stemmed

1 chile ancho, seeded and stemmed

3 chiles de arbol

1 small stick cinnamon

1 tsp brown sugar

salt to taste

1 jalape単o, minced

1 chipotle en adobo, minced

1 can whole skinned tomatoes

0\.5 white onion, diced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1\.5 cups black beans

1\.5 cups garbanzo

0\.5 cups red lentils, cleaned and rinsed

jalape単os en escabeche

handful of cilantro, roughly chiopped

### PROCESS

heat a dry pan on medium heat. add the coriander, cumin, oregano, paprika, chile pasilla, chile ancho, and 1 chile de arbol and toast for about a minute to a minute and a half. remove from heat from time to time to make sure the spices don't burn. turn heat off and put the chiles in a spice grinder/magic bullet/similar contraption and grind the chiles. add back to the pan and mix the spices together.

bring a large pot to medium heat, add your minced onion and cover for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. add the jalape単o and garlic and stir for about 2 minutes adding a little water if necessary (about a spoonful or two). add the dry spices and a little water and stir for another 5 minutes. now add the canned tomatoes one at a time. crush each one with your hand. stop at any point or add them all then stir and let cook for another 5 minutes. add the black beans and garbanzos along with about 1 - 2 cups of their liquid. bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer.

add the cinnamon stick, chile chipotle, remaining 2 chiles de arbol (chopped), sugar and salt to taste. simmer for about 15 minutes then add your red lentils and about a half cup of water (or more depending on how watery you want your chili). simmer on low for at least 30 minutes and remove the cinnamon stick. serve it with some jalape単os en escabeche and cilantro. **enjoy** the crap out of it.
